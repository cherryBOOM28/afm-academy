It includes a set of government, law enforcement and special agencies that implement state policy in the field of AML/CFT, in interaction and interrelation with subjects of financial monitoring.",
    "AntiLaunderingText2": "The formation of the AML/CFT system of the Republic of Kazakhstan can be divided into three stages", 
    "firstStage": "The first stage (2000-2008)",
    "secondStage": "The second stage (2008-2020)",
    "thirdStage": "The third stage (from 2021 to the present)",
    "descFirstStage": "By a resolution of the United Nations Security Council dated July 29, 2005, all Member countries of the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) are required to implement the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (hereinafter referred to as the FATF). In the implementation of these recommendations, a separate type of criminal offense has been criminalized - the legalization (laundering) of money and other property acquired illegally. International conventions have been ratified: on combating the financing of terrorism of October 2, 2002, the United Nations against Corruption of May 4, 2008 and the United Nations against Transnational Organized Crime of June 4, 2008. In 2004, in order to ensure economic security and prevent threats to financial stability, Kazakhstan became one of the founders of the FATF regional group - the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (hereinafter - the EAG). Its main activities are to ensure effective interaction and cooperation at the regional level, as well as integration at the level of the EAG member States into the international AML/CFT system.",
    "descSecondStage1": "In 2008, in order to implement the provisions of international acts obliging countries to establish a unit that will serve as a national center for the collection, analysis and dissemination of information in the field of AML/CFT, a financial intelligence unit was created in the form of a Financial Monitoring Committee within the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan (such bodies have been established in 163 countries around the world).",
    "descSecondStage2": "In 2009, the Law On Countering the Legalization (Laundering) of Proceeds from Crime and the Financing of Terrorism (hereinafter - the AML/CFT Law) was adopted, which laid the legal basis for the formation of state policy in the field of AML/CFT. He defined the basics of interaction and the terms of reference of state and law enforcement agencies, as well as subjects of financial monitoring, and introduced basic concepts.",
    "descSecondStage3": "At the same time, a unique information system for collecting and processing data from financial monitoring entities has been created that meets international quality and safety standards. Agreements on interaction and cooperation have been concluded both between government agencies and with countries of the near and far abroad.",
    "descSecondStage4": "In 2011, Kazakhstan became a full member of the Egmont group of financial intelligence units, which increased the effectiveness of cooperation with financial intelligence agencies of foreign countries. An active information exchange has begun with more than 100 financial intelligence units around the world. Under the coordination of the Financial Monitoring Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the AML/CFT system has successfully passed the first mutual assessment of the EAG.",
    "descSecondStage5": "The implementation of the fundamental norms of UN Security Council resolutions and FATF standards in terms of the activities of the financial intelligence unit, the powers and responsibilities of law enforcement agencies, international cooperation and mutual legal assistance and extradition, as well as issues of ensuring confiscation measures allowed Kazakhstan to receive ratings of significantly compliant and partially compliant according to 24 of the 40 FATF recommendations.",
    "descSecondStage6:": "Based on the results of the mutual assessment, the standard monitoring procedure was applied to Kazakhstan - a monitoring mechanism applied to all EAG member states that do not have significant deficiencies in technical compliance with the FATF recommendations and the AML/CFT system. The recommendations developed by the EAG experts based on the results of the mutual assessment formed the basis for measures to improve the national AML/CFT system.",
    "descSecondStage7": "In order to develop measures to implement state AML/CFT policy, increase their effectiveness, as well as coordinate measures aimed at reducing the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, an Interdepartmental Council on Preventing the Legalization (Laundering) of Proceeds from Crime and Terrorist Financing has been established.",
    "descSecondStage8": "Conceptual amendments have been made to the national AML/CFT legislation:",
    "descSecondStage9": "The state regulatory body has been defined for four types of financial monitoring entities (realtors, lawyers, leasing, accounting organizations and professional accountants);",
    "descSecondStage10": "The responsibility of all subjects of financial monitoring for non-compliance with the requirements of the AML/CFT Law has been strengthened;",
    "descSecondStage11": "the state body responsible for the accounting and use of confiscated property and the formation of a fund for such property has been identified;",
    "descSecondStage12": "International cooperation has been strengthened with regard to the exchange of information in the field of AML/CFT between financial control authorities and law enforcement agencies with foreign competent authorities;",
    "descSecondStage13": "The operations of public officials have become subject to financial monitoring.",
    "descSecondStage14": "In 2014, Kazakhstan joined the Council of Heads of Financial Intelligence Units of the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States (hereinafter - the CIS).",
    "descSecondStage15": "Another feature of this stage is the holding in 2018 of the first national assessment of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (hereinafter - ML/FT), which identified and minimized the key risks of ML/FT and vulnerabilities of the national AML/CFT system.",

    "descThirdStage1": "The status of the financial intelligence unit has been upgraded by creating an independent body accountable to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Financial Monitoring (hereinafter - the Agency). A characteristic feature of this body is the unification of financial monitoring functions, as well as the disclosure and investigation of economic offenses. Such synergy has further increased the effectiveness of the analytical work carried out, has allowed to shift the focus of work both in terms of prevention and in terms of combating the consequences.",
    "descThirdStage2": "Today, the financial intelligence unit occupies a unique position in the AML/CFT system, being at the junction of the activities of financial institutions, as well as law enforcement and authorized bodies. At the first level, financial monitoring entities, among the total mass of financial transactions carried out by them in the interests of their clients, identify suspicious transactions and transactions that fall under the criteria established by the AML/CFT Law, form special reports about them and send them to the financial intelligence unit. Each subject of financial monitoring is assigned a state regulatory body that monitors its activities.",
    "descThirdStage3": "At the second level, the financial intelligence unit processes and analyzes in detail the information received about suspicious financial transactions, additional information is requested, including from the subjects of financial monitoring themselves and various government agencies. The result of such an analysis is a conclusion on the presence or absence of signs of money laundering or terrorist financing in the information provided by the subjects of financial monitoring, which is sent to law enforcement agencies for the organization of verification measures. At the third level, law enforcement agencies conduct verification activities, based on the results of which a decision is made to initiate a pre-trial investigation.",
    "descThirdStage4": "In 2021, the second national ML/FT risk assessment was conducted, which identified the main risks, threats and vulnerabilities. The analysis of criminal law statistics showed that in the Republic of Kazakhstan, crimes with a high risk of ML/FT are: tax crimes, illegal economic activity, corruption, embezzlement of budget funds, fraud and illicit drug trafficking. The high risk of ML/FT is assigned to the banking sector, the sector of microfinance organizations, as well as the gambling business. Based on the results of the national risk assessment, all participants in the AML/CFT system are implementing measures aimed at reducing the identified risks and vulnerabilities.",
    "descThirdStage5": "In general, the dynamics of the AML/CFT system development in the Republic of Kazakhstan in the period from 2019 to 2021 demonstrates positive results. The number of subjects of financial monitoring covered by the AML/CFT system increased from 6 thousand to 9 thousand, including 2 thousand subjects from the financial sector, 7 thousand subjects from the non-financial sector. Thus, the level of cooperation between financial monitoring entities and the Agency has increased by 50%.",
    "descThirdStage6": "During the specified period, more than 5 million reports of suspicious and threshold transactions were received from financial monitoring entities. At the same time, 99% of the messages were sent by the financial sector. 2,132 analytical materials have been sent to law enforcement and special government agencies. As a result of the adoption of comprehensive measures to improve analytical work, the effectiveness of the use of financial intelligence unit materials by law enforcement agencies increased from 43.6% to 64%.",
    "descThirdStage7": "The procedure for interaction between the financial intelligence unit, law enforcement and special government agencies on requests has been simplified. Work has begun on the implementation of parallel financial investigations. In this regard, there has been an increase from 42 in 2019 to 56 in 2021 of the facts of registration of offenses for laundering proceeds from crime (by 33%).",
    "descThirdStage8": "The regular improvement of the AML/CFT system is evidenced by the trend of improvement in Kazakhstan's indicators in the international index of the Basel Institute of Management on Combating Money Laundering: from 6.27 points in 2019 to 4.87 points in 2021.",

    "descFatf1": "The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that develops international standards in the field of countering money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT), as well as evaluates the compliance of national AML/CFT systems with these standards.",
    "descFatf2": "The main tool of the FATF in the implementation of its mandate are 40 recommendations in the field of AML/CFT/FMT, which are audited on average once every five years. In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution No. 1617 (2005), 40 FATF Recommendations are mandatory international standards for implementation by UN member states.",
